## I Don't Eat Enough!

I have been trying to lose weight my whole life. I always faced a major problem: I do not eat enough! Yep, I said it. I am big, fat, and I do not eat enough! During the day, I starve myself, and at night I eat everything I can find or drink so much sugary drinks that I consume more calories than you could in a day. I have been trying to change that for a while now, and I have been using a calorie calculator to help me track my progress. I have found that it is a great tool for keeping me on track and making sure that I am eating the right amount of calories each day. I have also found that it is a great way to keep me motivated and to help me stay focused on my goals.

## Nutritional Facts That You Should Understand

All food is not equal. You would think that's evident, but it's more than that. Take cheese and meat; you would think it's fairly the same "density," but cheese has 1,400 calories per pound vs. 800 calories per pound for the meat! Potatoes have 450 calories per pound vs. 150 calories per pound for non-starchy vegetables! Choosing wisely your food will help you lose weight! When eating less dense food with more weight, it helps you feel fuller and stop binge eating[^1]! Looking at the glycemic index[^2] will also help with sugar craving and insulin level in your blood. The glycemic index is a number that describes how fast your body converts the carbs in a food into glucose. The smaller the number, the less impact the food has on your blood sugar. For example, brown rice has a GI of 55 vs. white rice, which has 89; in comparison, sugar has 65, cashews, on another hand, have 21! Choose wisely to help your body assimilate those carbs slowly; the more slowly it's released, the less hunger you feel between meals.

## At First, I Was Overwhelmed

When I first realized the importance of tracking my food intake, I'll admit, it felt overwhelming. I was not eating enough per meal, and adding all that food was IMPOSSIBLE for me! I can't eat that much at one sitting! Also, the concept of weighing food, reading nutrition labels, and writing down every meal seemed like a Herculean task reserved for the highly disciplined. However, my perspective shifted when I stumbled upon a practical and accessible approach: using a food scale and a calorie tracking app[^3].

These tools have significantly demystified the process for me. A food scale helps in understanding portion sizes, a fundamental aspect often misunderstood. On the other hand, calorie tracking apps, which are abundant and user-friendly, have become an invaluable ally. These apps not only facilitate the logging of daily meals but also offer insights into the nutritional composition of the foods I consume.

## The Role of Technology in Making Tracking Effortless

I'm a techy man. I love gadgets; it helps me find interest in "day-to-day" tasks. One of the features I appreciate most about these apps is the ability to scan barcodes of packaged foods, instantly logging nutritional information into my daily food diary. This feature simplifies what could otherwise be a tedious process, making it easier to maintain a consistent log. Additionally, these apps help in setting and adjusting macronutrient goals, aligning daily intake with personal weight loss objectives.

What began as a structured approach to weight loss has evolved into a journey of self-discovery and education about food and nutrition. It's not just about the numbers; it's about developing a deeper understanding of how different foods affect my body and overall well-being. This process has taught me the importance of balance and making informed food choicesâ€”recognizing that a seemingly small piece of lasagna might carry the same caloric load as a large, nutrient-dense salad, but with vastly different impacts on satiety and nutrition.

## Embracing Flexibility and Mindfulness

It's important to note that while tracking calories and macros can be a powerful tool for weight loss, it's equally important to approach this practice with flexibility and mindfulness. Being too rigid can lead to frustration or an unhealthy relationship with food. Instead, I view tracking as a guide to making more informed choices, not as an inflexible rulebook. Some days I'm still under my recommended calorie intake, and some days I'm over, and when I know that I have a supper with friends, I'm more careful during the day to help me stay in a reasonable bracket of calories for that day.

I hope to convey to you that while the path to understanding and managing calories, macros, glycemic index, and food density may appear intricate at first, it is indeed a manageable and rewarding endeavor. By leveraging simple tools like food scales and tracking apps, anyone can embark on this journey of nutritional awareness, leading to healthier choices and a more balanced diet. This is not prescriptive advice but rather a reflection of my own journey, one that underscores the importance of finding what works best for you in the pursuit of health and wellness.
