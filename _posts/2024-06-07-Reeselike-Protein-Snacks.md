| ISO Gold Isolated Whey Protein - Vanilla (PVL Elite) | 3 scoops | 360 calories |
| Nutri-Nut Powdered Peanut Butter (BioX) | 120g | 500 calories |

Melt your coconut oil, then mix all ingredient together except for the chocolate. When all homogenious form little ball of 14.5g then press them in your bar mold (I use ["Perfect Petites"](https://epicure.com/en-ca/product/1004231)). It should give you 24 little bar, when you're done portionning them, melt your chocolate in the microwave or using a bain marie, then poor equal part on each bar, I use a teaspoon of chocolate on each bar. Then freeze for an hour, and voilà! You have wonderful reese-like proteins bar!
