## Hi there, I'm Jonathan Lafleur ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm currently working at Gluwa as a DevOps engineer, where I collaborate closely with the frontend, backend, and blockchain teams to ensure the health and smooth deployment of our services.

After two decades in the industry, primarily catering to multiple clients simultaneously, I felt the need for a change. I sought a role where I could dedicate myself fully to a single project without jumping between multiple commitments.

Born in the 80s, I've always been fascinated by computers and new technologies, leading me to pursue a career in backend development and DevOps.

One of the highlights of my career was participating in Skills In Action for the CBDC Restigouche project before the COVID-19 pandemic, a project I'm particularly proud of.

As a DevOps professional, I approach problem-solving and decision-making with a collaborative mindset, working closely with cross-functional teams to address challenges and optimize processes.

Outside of work, I'm a DIY enthusiast, tinkering with Raspberry Pi, Arduino, modules, and exploring IoT projects. I'm also learning to play the piano and am the proud father of three sons.

In the future, I aspire to combine my passion for technology with my love for travel by working remotely from a Westfalia camper van, exploring the roads from Canada to Brazil.
